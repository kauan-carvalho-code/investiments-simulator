This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/), [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

## Technologies used

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a React framework focused on production and efficiency created and maintained by the Vercel team, Nextjs seeks to bring together several features such as hybrid and static content rendering, TypeScript support, pre-fetching, routing system, feature packs and several plugins and examples to speed up your development providing a complete framework for you to start your project.

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) language adds static typing to JavaScript, which originally has dynamic typing.

[Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/) is a library for React and React Native that allows you to use component-level styles in your application. They are written in a mixture of JavaScript and CSS.

[Eslint](https://eslint.org/) is a code analysis tool that, together with its extension of the same name available in VSCode, allows us to identify errors regarding the writing pattern we define.

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and reprinting it with its own rules that take into account the maximum line length, wrapping the code when necessary.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) enables developers to easily pack, ship, and run any application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container, which can run virtually anywhere. As Bottomley told me, "Containers gives you instant application portability.
